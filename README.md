## purpose
This assignment will help you understand how to inject small HTML files into your index.html page. You will also be implementing a new way to navigate using the URL instead of the href.   

## task
* If you don't understand how to inject views into your index page you watch the class lectures. 
* You will be creating a full-site with at least 5 pages and they must all have content with images and text. Try duplicating a site you like.  
* This must be a dynamic site, which means when I click on a link it injects the views into the page.
* You must also navigate using the URL and not the href's in the a tag. 
* Make sure you are using the MVC model that we have been using all semester.
* You can create any page and design that you like but you must have five pages and they must contain images and text. Lorem is fine to use. 
* Upload this to the web 4 server and to Github as well. Remember to add to. your Readme file and put the link to Web 4 inside the Readme file.
* Submit the Github link to this assignment.
